### Optimize Copy:
- [ ] Add specific pain points your ICP has

- [ ] Add FAQ section answering common objections

**Verification:** Landing page clearly communicates value and urgency

## Phase 4: First Customer Acquisition (24-48 hours)

### Strategy A: Direct Outreach (Highest Conversion)

**Target:** 5-10 people you know who:
- Run sales/marketing teams
- Currently pay for lead gen or data tools
- Would benefit from cheaper alternative

**Message Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I just launched WalterFetch - it's like ZoomInfo but 80% cheaper and gives you the exact ICP you need.

Instead of paying $15K/year for a database of everyone, you get:
- 500-2000+ verified leads/month
- Only your exact ICP
- $99-$499/month (I'm locking in early adopters at this rate)

I have 10 spots left at launch pricing. Want to see a demo with leads for [THEIR INDUSTRY]?

```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] List 10 potential customers you know
- [ ] Send personalized messages
- [ ] Offer to generate 10 free sample leads for them
- [ ] Schedule 15-min demo calls

**Goal:** 2-3 interested conversations → 1 customer

---

### Strategy B: Product Hunt / Reddit (Medium Effort, Medium Reward)

**Reddit:**
- [ ] Post in r/sales, r/entrepreneur, r/SaaS
- [ ] Title: "Built a ZoomInfo alternative for $99/mo (vs $15K/year)"
- [ ] Include demo link + special Reddit discount code
- [ ] Respond to all comments quickly

**Product Hunt:**
- [ ] Launch on Product Hunt
- [ ] Get 5 friends to upvote early
- [ ] Offer "Product Hunt Special: First month $49"
- [ ] Respond to all comments

**Goal:** 50-100 visitors → 5-10 trials → 1-2 customers

---

### Strategy C: Cold Outreach (Scalable but Lower Conversion)

**Target List:**
- Sales directors at 50-200 person B2B companies
- Growth marketers at agencies
- BDRs who need leads

**Tools:**
- Use Apollo.io free tier (50 credits)
- Find 50 prospects matching your ICP
- Send personalized emails

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: Cheaper alternative to [ZoomInfo/Seamless]?

2. **Demo:**
   - Share `/dashboard` link
   - Have them enter THEIR ICP
   - Generate sample leads live
   - "This is what you'd get weekly"

3. **Handle Objections:**
   - "How do I know quality is good?" → Show verification rate, offer money-back guarantee
   - "Too expensive" → Compare to alternatives, show ROI
   - "Need to think about it" → "I only have 10 launch spots left, locks in your rate"

4. **Close:**
   - "Want to start with Starter ($99) or Pro ($249)?"
   - Send them pricing link
   - Follow up in 2 hours if no response

5. **Deliver Value Immediately:**
   - Once they subscribe, email within 1 hour
   - "What's your exact ICP? I'll have your first batch ready tomorrow"
   - Over-deliver: Give them 600 leads if they paid for 500
